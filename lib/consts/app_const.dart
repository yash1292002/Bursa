    "text3":
        """\nWhere you use the Website, Bursa processes your Personal Data for various purposes, each of them being duly legitimated by a valid legal basis.
First, Bursa collects and processes your Personal Data for managing and following up any questions and/or requests you may submit. As such, please note that this processing is only carried out in the event you submit a question and/or request. Otherwise, your Personal Data are not processed for this purpose.
This processing requires that Bursa collect and process the following categories of Personal Data: 
    (i) identification data (i.e., your first name, your last name, and your contact details); 
    (ii) data related to your professional life (i.e., the identity of your employer and your job position); and 
    (iii) the content of the message(s) you sent to Bursa as part of your question/request.
While processing your Personal Data for this purpose, Bursa relies on its legitimate interest, which consists in duly managing its relationships with you.
Second, if you are an investor, you may have been granted by Bursa an investor account enabling you to access specific pages and contents through the Website.
For managing your investor account, and notably ensuring that you are entitled to access contents dedicated to investors only, Bursa needs to process and collect your identification data (i.e., your first name, your last name, your contact details as well as your login and password for accessing your investor account) as well as data related to your professional life (i.e. the identity of your employer). The legal basis of this processing is the necessity for Bursa to perform a contract to which you are a party.
Third, if you are willing to subscribe to its newsletter, Bursa needs to collect and process your email address, which is a Personal Data, in order to properly manage your subscription.
Please note however that Bursa will only send you its newsletter and process your email address accordingly provided it has obtained your prior consent, which constitutes the legal basis of this processing.
Lastly, as Bursa is willing to understand how users interact with its Website, it needs to process various browsing information resulting from cookies which qualify as Personal Data. Thus, the fourth category of processing Bursa carries out with your Personal Data is the performance of analytic operation related to the Website traffic and use.
In this respect, the legal basis Bursa relies upon is its legitimate interest which consists in: 
    (i) better understanding the way its Website is browsed by users (including you); and 
(ii) improving the Website where needed.
In any event, and disregarding the processing purpose at stake, please note that Bursa will comply with a strict data minimisation principle and will thus only collect and process Personal Data which is necessary for the above purposes.
Besides, for managing your questions/requests, your investor account as well as your subscription to the newsletter, the provision of your Personal Data is a contractual requirement. In this respect, sharing your Personal Data with Bursa is thus mandatory, otherwise Bursa will not be able to: 
    (i) address your questions/requests;

Another example is to be found with respect to cookies. Indeed, to perform the analytic operations regarding your use of the Website, Bursa relies on the services of Google LLC, which thus access and processes your Personal Data resulting from the use of cookies.
To the extent this is necessary, Bursa also communicates your Personal Data to other entities of the Bursa group (e.g., the question you submitted to Bursa actually concerns another entity of the Bursa group and the latter will thus contact you directly to answer your question if relevant).
